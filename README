Introduction
============

Thrudb is a set of simple services built on top of Facebook's
Thrift framework that provides indexing and document storage
services for building and scaling websites.

Its purpose is to offer web developers flexible, fast and
easy-to-use services which can enhance or replace
traditional data storage and access layers.

Please read the technical document for more information.
