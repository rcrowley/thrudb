Hi!

Thrudoc is a distributed key/value store designed to be flexible, scalable,
and reliable. Thrudoc is able to take your project from inception, through
development, all the way to scaled out production without changing a line of
code.

It has quite a few dependencies, but the good new is that you can
avoid many (almost all) of them by using --without-<backend> options. The disk
backend is a good place to start if you just want to try Thrudoc out. MySQL
is a good backend to build a site on top of. If you're working in Amazon EC2
you might want to take a look at the S3 backend. Regardless once you go in to
production you'll want to take a look at the Memcached backend, but keep in
mind that you make concession in potential (though unlikely) data
inconsistency.

Depending on your use-case you may want to look at another piece of software
called Thrucene (or something like it) which will allow you to index and search
your data.

best,
