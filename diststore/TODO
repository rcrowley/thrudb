* mysql backend arch doc
** talk about how multi master is a safe/good solution here and can provide for
failover 
** master -> slaves is a safe/good pattern for scaling masters, caching is
probably a lot better, see MySQLBackend todo's
* MySQLBackend manager
** will require introduction of a read-only mode
** put parition in to read only, wait for master info cache timeouts, then rework
* look at bloom filters
** not sure i really see them as useful with mysql
** they would need to be presisted through invocations and updated locally by all writes (if multiple svc boxes) to be useful, just sounds complicated
